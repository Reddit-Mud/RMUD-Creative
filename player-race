Ideas on how to handle PC races

1. No race: everyone is simply human, and that's that. This could very easily coincide with the homogenous
   base stats idea where everyone starts out the same, if we went that route. 
   
2. Human-based subclassification: Everyone is still human, but with very slightly different physical and
   mental attributes depending on which fictionalized sub-race they choose. This arguably forces an 
   early game defining decision on the player, since we would later have to specify which "classes and 
   subclasses" are available to each sub-race, but then again, allows us to award small bonuses for
   character customization. Some examples would be an 'Outdoorsman,' who might be awarded a Con bonus
   for higher HP in the sense that they are a bit heartier due to spending a lot of time hiking/hunting/etc.
   Or something like an athlete, that would give STR or DEX bonuses for obvious reasons. Those could 
   be hashed out fairly easily (with more creative names, I'd hope), having at least one sub-race for 
   each stat bonus. 
   
3. Ancient influence: If we decide on how to handle magic in a way that allows for it to be power that is 
   older than the human race itself, we could invent ways that it subtly influences people's physical and 
   mental attributes, but ideally keep that knowledge confined to the PC, so that when someone looks at 
   another player, they don't see something like "Race: Mindflayer" or whatever, keeping the real world
   with hidden magic feel. Basically everyone would appear as human to everyone else, only sharing their 
   race if they with to say it. Examples mighht be Shaman, Psychic, Faith Healer, etc. Basically real
   world claims that could concievably be powered by magic with enough imagination.
